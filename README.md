Hello World! My name is Eric Dunbar.
I am a CS major at the University of North Carolina at Asheville.
I am currently focusing on Artificial intelligence and Cybersecurity, and hope to persue my phd in one of those fields.
I am currently learning minimax implementations for games such as Othello and Chess, as well as taking classes in computer systems and algorithms.
