Hello World! My name is Eric Dunbar.
I am a CS major at the University of North Carolina at Asheville.
My focus in life is computer networking and cybersecurity but I also have a passion for coding. Some of my recent projects include Orchestrate, a network automation tool developed for my undergraduate capstone project, and Rthello, an Othello game with AI built in Rust.
